  <h2>🔵 Case Study: 34 Bookings in 2 Days — Without Spending a Dime on Ads</h2>
  <p><strong>Client Type:</strong> Veterinary Clinic (Faroe Islands)<br>
     <strong>Strategy Used:</strong> Organic DM Funnel</p>

  <h3>🐾 The Challenge</h3>
  <p>The clinic was entering its <strong>slowest season of the year</strong>.<br>
     No ad budget.<br>
     No active outreach on Instagram or Facebook.</p>
  <p>Their audience was there… but completely untapped.<br>
     They needed a <strong>fast, zero-cost way to fill appointments</strong> — without overloading their staff or changing internal systems.</p>

  <h3>🚀 The Strategy</h3>
  <p>I implemented a plug-and-play <strong>Organic DM Funnel</strong> that activated their existing audience — fast.</p>
  <p>Here’s how we made it work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>🧲 Built a low-barrier, limited-time <strong>intro offer</strong> tailored to pet owners</li>
    <li>📲 Designed <strong>story + post templates</strong> that sparked interest and urgency</li>
    <li>💬 Wrote <strong>DM scripts</strong> their team could copy-paste to close bookings quickly</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All using their current social accounts — with <strong>zero additional cost</strong>.</p>

  <h3>📈 The Results</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>34</strong> total appointments booked in just 48 hours</li>
    <li><strong>15</strong> paid consultations → <strong>22,500 DKK</strong> in new revenue</li>
    <li><strong>0 DKK</strong> spent on ads</li>
  </ul>
  <p>✅ Fully booked — during one of their <em>slowest months</em></p>

  <h3>💡 Why It Worked</h3>
  <p>This wasn’t a pushy promo or gimmick.<br>
     It was a <strong>strategic offer</strong> backed by urgency, social proof, and friction-free team execution.</p>
  <p>We didn’t just drive clicks. We drove <strong>cash flow</strong> — fast.</p>
